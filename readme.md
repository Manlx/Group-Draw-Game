# To start the server
As you can see there is a client and a server.

The server is just a websocket server running in node.

The client is a vite development of ReactTS.

So to start we need to run both the server and the client

## Server start command:
``` npm run start ```

## Client start command:
``` cd .\client\ ;; npm run dev ```
